# microservice-exercise

This is an Example of Microservice Architecture provided by this Tutorial on YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPPhcU7oWDU&t=30s

The full example can be viewed at https://github.com/SaiUpadhyayula/spring-boot-microservices

I used this to exercise in developing microservices in Spring Boot.

The Architecture consists of 3 Services: Order, Inventory and Product, an API-Gateway to reach the services and a discovery server.

It can be built using maven.
